This is an android application basically designed for a food delivering service for a small area... specifically designed for the campus of BIT Mesra,Ranchi mentioning the major locations where food can be delivered.
The app basically shows a list of restaurents from which you can choose the food items you want to order according to the price and the estimated time taken for delivery. Then you can put the items in cart and once you are satisfied with the order, you can proceed to checkout the order.
The list of your order would be displayed along with the total price that would cost the customer along with all the taxes and delivery charges.
Then the payment mode can be chose according to the user i.e, paytm,phonepe and google pay.
The payment had to be done in advance and the order would be delivered to your address as soon as possible.
